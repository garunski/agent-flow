LLM Orchestration: Reasoning Without Execution

Show thinking

Conceptualizing the LLM Orchestration Framework
I am beginning the research and design process for a conceptual LLM orchestration framework. This system is unique because it strictly separates reasoning and planning (handled by LLMs) from execution (handled by an external executor). My initial thought process has defined the necessary architectural layers and components to meet the requirements of the task.
Workflow Separation and Context Goals
The core of the design involves a two-stage LLM process: a Strategy Generator creates a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for the high-level plan, and a Task Decomposer breaks down each DAG node into atomic tool intents. A major design challenge I am focused on resolving is ensuring strict minimal context injection for each LLM call to optimize token usage and guarantee that LLMs only reason and never perform execution.
Initial Research Plan
To build this conceptual design, I have outlined five initial research themes: designing the structured output for the LLM-generated DAG, defining the schema for atomic tool intents, researching techniques for minimal context injection, defining the external Validation/Execution Layer, and conducting a comparative analysis against existing frameworks like AutoGen and LangGraph to highlight the design's unique advantages.

Establishing Architectural Components
My initial research successfully validated the core concepts of the proposed framework. I confirmed that generating structured outputs, specifically Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), using tools like Pydantic, is a standard and robust method for large language models (LLMs) to plan complex workflows. This is essential for the Strategy Generator LLM. Similarly, the concept of breaking down tasks into 'atomic steps' for tool interaction is a recognized technique for enhancing reasoning and reliability in multi-stage systems.
Addressing Key Design Goals
I gathered crucial information aligning with the project's strict requirements. For token efficiency, I confirmed that selective or 'minimal context' injection (as opposed to simply increasing context window size) is the optimal approach, leveraging techniques like those found in the SMART framework. For security and auditability, the necessity of an external, non-LLM execution layer is strongly supported by research on LLM tool usage security, focusing on eliminating code execution risks and enabling auditable 'Record & Replay' workflows.
Moving from Components to Structure
While I have established the necessity of the components (Strategy LLM, Task LLM, Executor), the next critical phase is defining the specific, conceptual data structures that link them. I need to define the precise schemas for the LLM-generated DAG (Node ID, Dependencies) and the Task Decomposer's tool intent (Action Type, Parameters). This focus will ensure the separation of concerns and the strict validation goals of the framework are met before execution.

Smarter Memories, Stronger Agents: How Selective Recall Boosts LLM Performance
Synthesizing the Data Structures
The second round of research successfully confirmed and defined the precise conceptual data structures required for my three-layered framework. I now have clarity on the structure of the Strategy Generator's output, which will be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) enforced with explicit fields like `Dependencies` and, critically, `Inputs from Dependencies` to enforce the minimal context rule. Similarly, the Task Decomposer's output (the 'intent') is confirmed to align with a structured JSON schema, leveraging existing tool-calling paradigms where the LLM specifies the `Function Name` and `Parameter Object`, but the execution remains external.
Ensuring Auditability and Efficiency
I have identified the technical mechanisms necessary to meet the demanding design goals. To optimize token usage and minimize context, I will employ selective memory retrieval and context projection techniques. For auditability and maintenance, the system will feature a 'Record & Replay' capability, logging the entire execution trace, including LLM inputs, outputs, and the tool execution results, ensuring the workflow is fully deterministic and auditable.
Defining the Validation Layer's Role
A crucial finding involves the Validation Layer, which sits between the LLMs and the Executor. Research confirmed that this layer must include a Policy Engine to inspect the LLM-generated intent for security vulnerabilities (such as prompt injection or out-of-scope actions) before the external tool is invoked. This explicitly addresses the requirement for strict separation of reasoning and execution and enhances system security.
Finalizing the Conceptual Design
With all components and mechanisms defined, the remaining step is the final synthesis. I will now perform a targeted search to solidify the terminology and focus entirely on constructing the robust comparative analysis, highlighting the specific advantages of my Decoupled Execution Model (Reasoning LLMs <-> Orchestrator/Validator <-> External Executor) against conventional multi-agent frameworks like LangGraph and AutoGen, thereby completing the requirements.

Decoupled Architecture Confirmed
I have successfully synthesized the information, confirming the viability of the three-layered conceptual framework: Strategy Generator (LLM-A) $\rightarrow$ Task Decomposer (LLM-B) $\rightarrow$ Executor. The Strategy LLM is responsible for producing a high-level, structured Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) plan, while the Task LLM breaks down specific nodes into atomic, non-executable tool intents. The critical insight is that this architecture naturally aligns with concepts like 'decoupled cognitive architecture,' which strictly enforces the separation between the LLM's reasoning and the external system's action execution, enhancing both security and auditability.
Advantages Over Existing Frameworks
The final phase of my research provided strong evidence to clearly articulate the advantages of this new design compared to conventional frameworks like AutoGen and LangGraph. My architecture ensures the LLM's output is purely an 'Action Prediction,' which is then validated by an external Policy Engine before execution. This process creates an LLM-Agnostic Abstraction Layer, which is far more secure and auditable, as the system procedure remains immutable and external to the potentially mutable LLM reasoning process.
Finalizing the Conceptual Design
All core requirements have been met and saturated. I have confirmed the use of structured outputs (Pydantic/JSON Schema) for both the DAG and the tool Intents, established mechanisms for minimal context injection (Context Projection/Summarization), and defined the robust auditability layer via Record & Replay capabilities. With all research complete, I am now ready to construct the final high-level design report and analysis.


The Decoupled Reasoning DAG (DRD) Framework: A Blueprint for Trustless LLM Orchestration


I. Executive Summary and the Trustless Reasoning Paradigm (TRP)

The development of advanced agentic systems requires a fundamental reconciliation between the flexibility and complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the essential enterprise demands for security, auditability, and deterministic control. Traditional orchestration frameworks often integrate LLM reasoning and real-world tool execution, leading to systems vulnerable to non-determinism, security risks, and high operational costs due to extensive context usage.1
The Decoupled Reasoning DAG (DRD) Framework is proposed as a conceptual blueprint specifically designed to resolve this conflict. The architecture operates under the strict governance of the Trustless Reasoning Paradigm (TRP). This paradigm enforces a strict division of labor: LLMs are utilized solely as sophisticated planning and semantic processing engines, generating highly structured Intents (proposals for action) but never possessing the authority to execute external tools or code.3 Execution authority is externalized to a deterministic, security-hardened layer.

I.A. The Architectural Mandate: Reasoning vs. Execution

Modern LLMs demonstrate exceptional competence in high-level cognitive tasks, including planning, complex reasoning, and semantic understanding.5 The DRD Framework leverages this strength by employing a two-tiered LLM strategy that formalizes the separation of concerns, thereby preventing the "cognitive overloading" that occurs when a single model is tasked with both abstract strategic planning and detailed, low-level execution sequencing.4
By mandating that LLMs only output structured representations of intended actions, the system fundamentally mitigates the risks associated with granting models direct agency.8 Integrated execution capabilities expose systems to severe security vulnerabilities, including code execution risks and various injection attacks, particularly when tools like code interpreters are involved.1 The TRP dictates that all LLM outputs must be viewed as potentially non-deterministic proposals that require validation by an external, deterministic policy layer before they can be translated into real-world actions.9 This systematic approach prioritizes reliability and security in high-stakes operational environments over emergent agent autonomy.

I.B. Core Design Pillars of the DRD Framework

The DRD architecture is founded upon three central design pillars:
Structured Planning via DAG Generation: The framework requires the initial LLM (Strategy Generator) to convert an unstructured natural-language problem into a formal, machine-readable Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).10 This DAG serves as the rigorous, immutable workflow blueprint, ensuring logical progression and explicit dependency mapping.12
Intent Atomicity: To facilitate simplification, granular control, and robust verification, tasks derived from the DAG are broken down into the smallest possible units: atomic steps.7 This ensures that the generated tool intents are semantically minimal and easily verifiable by the downstream Policy Engine against predefined acceptable actions.13
Minimal Context Projection: A core mandate for cost efficiency is the optimization of LLM context window usage. The framework provides each LLM interaction with strictly necessary, contextually relevant information, often requiring summarization or targeted retrieval from prior steps.14 This approach strategically manages operational cost and dramatically improves performance efficiency by avoiding unnecessary context processing.
The inherent requirement for a Deterministic Checkpoint—where the LLM’s non-deterministic output is formally structured and then validated by a deterministic policy layer—is an essential architectural choice. This structure enables the orchestrator to isolate failure: a flawed process plan points to the LLM's reasoning, while an unexpected tool result points to the execution environment. This facilitates rapid Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and targeted debugging, which is a critical feature for production-grade AI systems.16

II. Conceptual Architecture: Layers and Immutable Data Stores

The DRD Framework is defined by a modular, three-layered architecture designed to maintain strict separation of duties and maximize auditability.

II.A. The Three-Layered DRD Architecture

The workflow progresses strictly through these three vertical layers, managed by a central Orchestrator component.
Planning Layer (Strategy Generator LLM): This layer takes the initial complex natural language problem and transforms it into the macro structure of the solution. The output is the Structured DAG Manifesto (see Section III), defining the high-level tasks and dependencies. The LLM's focus here is global coherence and strategic planning.19
Tasking Layer (Task Decomposer LLM): This layer operates on an individual node basis. It receives a specific node from the DAG and its required minimal context. Its output is one or more Structured Atomic Tool Intents (see Section V). The focus is atomic step generation, precise tool selection, and rigorous parameterization.
Execution Layer (Execution Gateway & Policy Engine): This layer receives the proposed Intent from the Tasking Layer. It performs mandatory validation via the Policy Engine and, upon approval, translates the structured intent into a real-world operation (read, write, API call, etc.). Its focus is determinism, adherence to security policies, and reliable Input/Output (I/O) handling.3

II.B. Central Artifacts for Auditability and Replayability

To ensure the system is auditable, maintainable, and replayable, the DRD architecture enforces the creation of three primary, immutable data structures, logged chronologically by the Orchestrator. This forensic trace is necessary for regulatory compliance and system monitoring.16
The DAG Manifesto: This is the finalized, validated JSON representation of the entire workflow structure, generated by the Strategy LLM.19 It defines all nodes, their internal descriptions, and all inter-node dependencies. As an immutable blueprint, it establishes the intended sequence of operations for any given complex problem.
The Intent Ledger: This chronological log records every structured Atomic Tool Intent generated by the Task Decomposer LLM, including the specific node_id it originated from, the tool_name proposed, and the parameterized inputs. This ledger represents the LLM's complete cognitive trace—its step-by-step requests for action.
The Execution Log: This record logs the outcome of every tool invocation performed by the Execution Gateway. It includes the corresponding intent_id, the precise time of execution, the deterministic input parameters used, and the raw, verified result data obtained from the external tool or environment.
The deliberate decoupling of the Intent Ledger (the LLM's proposed plan) from the Execution Log (the real-world outcome) is a fundamental feature enabling transparent failure analysis.18 This architecture ensures that the entire operational history—from the high-level strategy down to the I/O data—is traceable, allowing any specific run to be perfectly reconstructed and replayed for quality assurance or compliance purposes.17

III. Planning Layer: Strategy Generation via Structured DAG

The initial stage of the DRD framework focuses on translating the natural language input into a formal, graph-based planning structure.

III.A. The Strategy Generator LLM and Structural Constraints

The Strategy Generator LLM must possess high capabilities in logical reasoning and structured planning.5 Its output is restricted to generating the initial workflow blueprint, ensuring its mandate is purely structural decomposition. The choice of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is intentional because this structure inherently manages control flow, captures sequential and parallel dependencies, and prevents circular logic (cycles), which is critical for reliable and predictable workflow automation.11
The Orchestrator must immediately subject the raw LLM output (the proposed DAG Manifesto) to rigorous structural validation. Validation techniques include graph traversal algorithms to check for connectivity, confirm acyclicity, and verify that all defined node dependencies are correctly referenced.21 This ensures the foundational integrity of the workflow before any execution steps are initiated.

III.B. Formal Definition of the DAG Manifesto Schema

To ensure consistency and machine-readability, the Strategy Generator LLM’s output must strictly adhere to a standardized JSON Schema.22 This schema defines the structure of each workflow node and its relationships. Leveraging tools based on frameworks like Pydantic is crucial for enforcing this consistency and reliability in the LLM's response generation.23
The structure of the DAG Manifesto Node Schema is defined as follows:
DAG Manifesto Node Schema (Strategy Generator Output)

Field
Data Type
Description
Requirement
node_id
String (UUID)
Unique identifier for the task node.
Mandatory, Primary Key
task_name
String
High-level goal or function of the node (e.g., "ResearchMarketData").
Mandatory
description
String
Detailed human-readable description of the intended process within this node.19
Mandatory, for auditability
dependencies
Array of node_id
List of parent nodes that must complete before this task begins.
Mandatory, checks for acyclicity
input_map
Array of {source_node_id, source_output_key, target_input_key}
Explicitly maps data from predecessor outputs to this node's inputs.19
Mandatory, enforces minimal context input
expected_output_type
JSON Schema Reference
Defines the expected resulting data structure upon completion (used for validation).
Mandatory

The implementation of the explicit input_map field is particularly important. By requiring the Strategy LLM to specify precisely which output keys from preceding nodes are needed, the DAG generation process is inherently tied to the minimal context requirement.19 This mechanism acts as a programmatic constraint that pre-filters the context, ensuring the subsequent Tasking Layer receives only essential information, thereby establishing the foundation for token optimization.2

IV. Tasking Layer: Atomic Decomposition and Context Minimization

The Tasking Layer is responsible for translating the high-level plan (the DAG node) into actionable, granular instructions while strictly managing the computational resources utilized by the LLM.

IV.A. The Task Decomposer LLM and Atomic Step Principle

The Task Decomposer LLM is highly specialized for execution planning. When a node becomes executable (i.e., all its dependencies are met), this LLM is invoked. It receives the task_name, description, and the synthesized minimal inputs, and it generates a sequence of one or more "Atomic Tool Intents".25
This process relies on the principle of Atomic Decomposition. The model is guided to construct reasoning pathways composed of minimal semantic steps, analogous to the Self-structured Chain of Thought (SCoT) approach.7 By forcing the output into discrete, atomic units, the tool intents become extremely granular. This simplification significantly benefits the Policy Engine, making the subsequent validation of the execution request against security constraints more straightforward and reliable.13

IV.B. The Context Projection Module (Minimal Context Strategy)

Achieving token efficiency and cost savings necessitates moving context management out of the LLM's domain and into the orchestration layer.14 The Orchestrator acts as the LLM’s external, disciplined working memory.26 This responsibility is managed by the Context Projection Module.
Selective Retrieval: Instead of providing the entire, potentially lengthy history of execution, the module uses the current node's requirements (specifically the input_map defined in the DAG Manifesto) to selectively retrieve only the requisite data points from the system's long-term memory or data store.28
Dynamic Context Summarization: The sheer volume of data, especially in research or document processing tasks, can quickly overwhelm even modern, long-context LLMs, leading to higher operational costs and performance degradation (the "Lost in the Middle" effect).2 If a required previous node output is excessively long (e.g., thousands of tokens), a dedicated Summarization Module (potentially a smaller, optimized LLM) is triggered. This module abstracts the raw output into a concise summary or a context-aware vector representation.29 The final, token-optimized context is then "projected" to the Task Decomposer LLM, guaranteeing that it operates with the minimum amount of information required for accurate reasoning, thereby significantly reducing API costs.14
The architecture actively addresses the limitation that LLMs cannot reliably manage their own context window size, particularly in multi-step tasks.31 By orchestrating the context retrieval and summarization as a deterministic pre-processing step, the framework ensures optimal resource utilization while maintaining the fidelity of the LLM’s input.2

V. Execution Layer: Validation, Policy, and Deterministic Action

The Execution Layer is the point where LLM-generated proposals are translated into verified, controlled action, ensuring adherence to the Trustless Reasoning Paradigm. This layer is non-LLM based and deterministic.

V.A. The Atomic Tool Intent Schema

The sole output of the Task Decomposer LLM, and the definitive interface between the reasoning layer and the execution layer, is the Atomic Tool Intent. This output must be structured and validated, typically as a JSON object, replacing raw text generation with predictable data structures.32
Atomic Tool Intent Schema (Task Decomposer Output)
Field
Data Type
Description
Validation Requirements
intent_id
String (UUID)
Unique identifier for this specific atomic action.
Mandatory, unique
tool_name
String
Name of the authorized tool/function to be invoked (e.g., "WebSearchAPI", "FileWrite").
Must match allowed tool registry list
parameters
Key-Value Object
Strictly typed arguments and values required by the specific tool_name.
Must conform to tool's strict JSON schema
requires_confirmation
Boolean
Flag indicating if this intent requires a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) review before execution (e.g., critical writes).
Optional, for high-risk operations
expected_output_schema
JSON Schema Reference
Expected structure of the result to be returned by the Executor.
Mandatory, for result verification


V.B. The Two-Stage Intent Validation Pipeline

Before any real-world operation is initiated, the Atomic Tool Intent must successfully pass a mandatory two-stage validation process:
Syntactic/Schema Validation: Upon receipt, the Orchestrator performs an immediate structural check against the predefined schema of the intended tool_name.24 This guarantees that the JSON output is syntactically correct and that all parameters are present and conform to their defined data types, eliminating fragile outputs common in non-validated LLM generation.33
Semantic/Policy Validation (The Policy Engine): This constitutes the critical security guardrail. The Policy Engine operates as a deterministic proxy, inspecting the intent's semantic meaning and operational scope against hard-coded security and policy rules.9
Scope Checking: The Policy Engine ensures the intent is not asking for an Out-of-Scope (OOS) action, such as attempting to access unauthorized network resources or system files.34 This often involves comparing the user intent against a repository of allowed actions, potentially utilizing semantic matching rather than brittle regex rules.35
Safety Checking: This mechanism actively scans the intent parameters for known adversarial patterns, preventing attacks such as remote command injection or server-side request forgery (SSRF) attempts embedded within parameters like file paths or URLs.1
The formalization of the Tool Intent Schema and its rigorous validation establishes a definitive security boundary.38 Even if the LLM is successfully compromised via a prompt injection attack, the malicious instruction is captured within a structured format.39 The deterministic Policy Engine, which is intentionally non-LLM based, cannot be bypassed by linguistic manipulation, effectively containing the threat and preventing unauthorized execution.9

V.C. The External Execution Gateway

The External Execution Gateway is the only component within the DRD framework authorized to perform physical operations (e.g., database queries, network requests, file manipulation).3 It receives the intent only after it has been fully validated and approved by the Policy Engine.
The Gateway executes the action and ensures the resulting data strictly adheres to the expected_output_schema specified in the Intent. This rigorous adherence allows the Orchestrator to reliably parse, validate, and record the result into the immutable Execution Log before using it as contextual input for subsequent LLM calls. This mechanism guarantees a clean, reliable, and deterministic link between the LLM's proposed intent and the achieved outcome.18

VI. Architectural Advantages and System Properties

The DRD conceptual framework provides distinct, fundamental benefits over traditional, highly agentic architectures, primarily centered on high-assurance operations.

VI.A. Enhanced Security and Safety by Design

The core separation inherent in the TRP significantly enhances the system's security posture. By forcing LLMs to act strictly as generators of proposals, the architecture eliminates the high-risk scenario of LLMs having direct decision authority over resource access or execution (mitigation of Excessive Agency).8
The two-stage validation pipeline acts as a robust, layered defense.36 Input validation and policy checking at the Execution Layer prevent malicious instructions embedded in user prompts from compromising the underlying system, safeguarding against remote code execution and data leaks often associated with integrated tool usage.1 The system design emphasizes deterministic, non-LLM controls for critical security functions, providing reliable defense against complex LLM attack vectors.9

VI.B. Superior Auditability and Debugging (RCA)

High-assurance systems, particularly those in regulated industries, require the ability to demonstrate exactly how a conclusion or action was reached (Process-Based Supervision).6 The immutable DAG Manifesto, the Intent Ledger, and the Execution Log together provide a mathematically auditable, complete, and chronological forensic trace of the entire operation.20
The architecture enables perfect system reconstruction and Replayability.18 Because the strategy (DAG) and the atomic execution steps (Intent Ledger) are fixed and logged, they are decoupled from the dynamic state of the LLM itself. If a failure occurs, the trace can be re-run deterministically for quality assurance, compliance verification, or targeted debugging. The logging includes all prompts, responses, and tool invocation traces, streamlining Root Cause Analysis (RCA) by immediately isolating whether the fault lies in the LLM's plan or the external execution environment.17 This architectural clarity shifts LLM applications from opaque "black box" systems toward transparent, accountable "grey box" operations, increasing regulatory confidence.

VI.C. Cost and Performance Optimization

The rigorous adherence to the Minimal Context constraint yields substantial operational efficiencies.
The Context Projection Module, combined with the two-tiered LLM strategy, ensures that the LLM is invoked only at critical reasoning junctures and is supplied with the smallest necessary prompt context.2 By pre-summarizing lengthy data and filtering irrelevant history, the framework significantly reduces token usage and associated API costs compared to systems that rely on large, conversational context windows.2
Furthermore, once a workflow defined in the DAG Manifesto has been successfully validated and executed, the system gains Execution Efficiency. Executing a pre-derived sequence of atomic, structured steps (a "re-playable plan" derived from the Intent Ledger) is inherently faster and more reliable than requiring dynamic, step-by-step reasoning for every future, similar task.18

VII. Comparative Analysis: DRD vs. Existing Orchestration Frameworks

While existing frameworks like LangGraph, AutoGen, and others utilize elements such as multi-agent orchestration, DAG-based concepts, and structured tool calls, the DRD Framework introduces architectural invariants that conceptually distinguish it for high-security, high-auditability use cases.

VII.A. Contrast with State-Based, Conversational Frameworks (e.g., AutoGen)

Frameworks like AutoGen typically model tasks as dynamic, event-driven dialogues between multiple specialized agents, where control flow emerges from conversation and state is often managed via per-agent memory caches.41
The DRD Framework fundamentally diverges by prioritizing a fixed, structured DAG Manifesto over emergent conversational flow. State management is not distributed across asynchronous messages; rather, it is centralized, formalized in the immutable logs, and meticulously projected (Context Projection) to the LLMs on a need-to-know basis.41 The DRD sacrifices the spontaneous flexibility of dialogue-driven autonomy for the predictability, security, and traceability provided by a formally planned structure.

VII.B. Contrast with Integrated DAG/Graph Frameworks (e.g., LangGraph)

Frameworks such as LangGraph employ directed acyclic graphs for workflow orchestration, supporting powerful features like loops and dynamic transitions based on a centralized, mutable state.41 Critically, nodes within these frameworks often integrate and execute tools directly.
The DRD Framework maintains a hard conceptual separation between the LLM reasoning (the graph generation and atomic decomposition) and the Execution Layer. LLMs in the DRD architecture never execute tools; they interact only with the Policy Engine and Intent Validation layer.3 Furthermore, the DRD uses a strict minimal context strategy, contrasting with LangGraph’s centralized, often expansive, mutable global state management.41 The architectural choice here is a deliberate trade-off: forfeiting the dynamic flexibility of runtime-adjustable graphs for the absolute determinism and rigorous auditability required in environments where control and security are paramount.43

VIII. Conclusion and Future Research Directions


VIII.A. Summary of the DRD Conceptual Blueprint

The Decoupled Reasoning DAG (DRD) Framework provides a robust, high-assurance blueprint for LLM orchestration in complex problem-solving domains. By formally separating planning (Strategy LLM), decomposition (Task LLM), and execution (Execution Gateway), the architecture achieves unprecedented levels of security, auditability, and token efficiency. The TRP successfully transforms LLMs from potentially risky autonomous agents into highly specialized, cost-efficient, and structurally auditable reasoning engines. Through the adoption of immutable data structures (Manifesto, Ledger, Log) and a non-LLM-based Policy Engine, the framework addresses the critical needs of enterprise and research applications where control and compliance are mandatory requirements.

VIII.B. Future Research Trajectories

While the conceptual architecture establishes the necessary governance layers, further refinement of the dynamic components is necessary:
Context Projection Refinement: Ongoing research should explore advanced context encoding techniques beyond simple summarization. Utilizing methods such as encoding context information into concise, context-aware vectors before injection into the LLM could further minimize input tokens without compromising the depth of information available for reasoning.30
Adaptive Policy Engine Development: To combat evolving adversarial threats and refine operational boundaries, research must focus on making the Policy Engine adaptive. This would involve developing mechanisms to dynamically update policy rules based on aggregated, verified Execution Log data, allowing the system to autonomously learn safety boundaries and enhance resilience against novel injection techniques.39
Intelligent Graph Regeneration: The failure of an atomic execution step currently requires intervention from the Orchestrator. Future work should investigate structured methodologies for the Orchestrator to propose minimal, localized edits to the DAG Manifesto following an execution failure, leveraging LLM intervention only for high-level plan correction rather than generating the entire graph from scratch.21 This would improve recovery efficiency and execution fluidity while preserving the core integrity of the audited DAG Manifesto.
