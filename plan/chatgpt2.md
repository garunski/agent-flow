You are a system architect and researcher for advanced LLM orchestration.

Your task is to design a conceptual framework for a tool that allows LLMs to reason about complex problems via a structured workflow, while **never executing tools themselves**. You must produce a detailed, high-level design and analysis. you must not give code. just diagrams and descriptions. think through each piece.

Requirements:

1. **Workflow Overview**
   - One LLM (Strategy Generator) analyzes a natural-language problem and produces a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** as a plan. Nodes represent tasks; edges represent dependencies.
   - A second LLM (Task Decomposer) takes each node and breaks it into **atomic steps**, indicating what **tools or actions** will be required, but **not performing them**.
   - Each LLM interaction should receive **minimal context**: only the necessary prior outputs and relevant static information to perform reasoning for that task.
   - The tool layer / executor is responsible for performing all real operations (read, write, replace, API calls, etc.) based on the LLM-indicated intents.

2. **Design Goals**
   - Minimize LLM token usage by isolating context per step.
   - Ensure LLMs only reason and plan; execution is separated.
   - DAG must be replayable, auditable, and maintainable.
   - Intent outputs from LLMs should be **structured and validated** before execution.
   - Provide clear separation of concerns: Strategy LLM → Task LLM → Executor.

3. **Comparison with Existing Tools**
   - Existing frameworks (Teola, AutoGen, LangGraph, LangDAG, Action Engine) partially overlap:
     - Multi-agent orchestration.
     - DAG-based execution.
     - Structured outputs for tool calls.
   - Your design differs because:
     - The DAG is **LLM-generated** as a first step.
     - Each node runs with **strict minimal context**.
     - LLMs never execute tools, only indicate intents.
     - Execution is fully handled externally and validated.

4. **Deliverables**
   - High-level conceptual design for such a system.
   - Explanation of the workflow (Strategy LLM → Task LLM → Executor).
   - Notes on advantages of this approach vs existing frameworks.
   - Optional: Suggest components, layers, and data structures at a conceptual level (no code needed).

Constraints:
- Focus on reasoning flow, DAG orchestration, intent separation, and context optimization.
- Avoid specifying code or implementation details.
- Keep the description clear for technical and research audiences.

Here’s a high-level conceptual framework for an LLM orchestration system that satisfies your requirements. I’ve structured it as a comprehensive design with diagrams and analysis.

1. Conceptual Overview
We are designing a system that allows LLMs to reason, plan, and decompose complex tasks without ever executing them. Execution is fully externalized to a dedicated Executor Layer. The system emphasizes structured reasoning, minimal context, and auditability.

Key Principles
Separation of Concerns: Strategy LLM plans, Task LLM decomposes, Executor performs.

Minimal Context per Step: Each LLM only sees what is required for reasoning on that node.

Structured Output: DAG nodes and atomic steps are formalized and validated before execution.

Replayability & Auditability: Every DAG and task decomposition is stored for inspection and replay.

2. Workflow Architecture
+-----------------+      +----------------+      +------------------+
|  Strategy LLM   | ---> |  Task Decomposer| ---> | Executor Layer   |

   | DAG Storage / Log  |   | Task Storage / Log|    | Tool/Action APIs  |
   | (nodes & edges)   |   | (atomic steps)   |    | (external ops)   |
   +-------------------+   +-------------------+    +-------------------+
Step-by-Step Workflow
Problem Input:
User provides a natural-language problem or goal.

Strategy Generation (Strategy LLM):

Receives the problem statement and static references.

Produces a DAG, where each node represents a sub-goal/task.

Nodes include metadata: task type, prerequisites, estimated effort, optional tool suggestions.

DAG stored in structured format (JSON, graph database, or similar).

Task Decomposition (Task LLM):

Receives one DAG node at a time, minimal context (parent nodes, relevant metadata).

Breaks node into atomic steps with explicit intents:

Action type (e.g., “fetch data”, “transform file”, “call API”)

Target (e.g., URL, file, database)

Parameters or constraints

Validates structure and consistency (all steps have clear input/output).

Steps are stored in task storage, linked to DAG nodes.

Execution (Executor Layer):

Reads atomic step intents.

Performs actions using proper tools, APIs, or system calls.

Returns structured results, status, and logs.

Optionally feeds results back for DAG-level reasoning or dynamic planning.

3. Data Structures (Conceptual)
DAG Node
Node {
    id: string
    description: string
    dependencies: [node_ids]
    metadata: {
        estimated_cost,
        suggested_tools,
        constraints
    }
}
Atomic Step
Step {
    id: string
    parent_node_id: string
    action_type: string      // e.g., FETCH, TRANSFORM, VALIDATE
    target: string           // URL, file path, resource identifier
    parameters: dict
    validation_rules: dict
}
Intent Validation
Ensures all required fields are present.

Confirms no ambiguous actions.

Confirms step dependencies respect DAG ordering.

4. Context Management
Minimal Context Principle: Each LLM receives only:

Relevant DAG node description.

Immediate dependency results (if needed for reasoning, not execution).

Benefits:

Reduces token usage.

Prevents information leakage across unrelated tasks.

Makes reasoning deterministic and reproducible.

5. Advantages Over Existing Frameworks
Feature	Existing Tools	Proposed Design
DAG Generation	Often pre-defined by human or auto-generated partially	Fully LLM-generated DAG from problem statement
LLM Context	Multi-agent frameworks may provide full shared context	Strict per-node minimal context
LLM Execution	Some tools allow LLMs to directly call APIs	LLMs never execute tools; outputs are intents only
Replayability	Depends on logging	Structured DAG and step logs allow full replay and audit
Validation	Sometimes ad-hoc	Intent outputs are structured and validated before execution
Modularity	Mixed orchestration and execution	Clear separation: Strategy → Task → Executor
6. Optional System Components
Strategy Layer

Problem ingestion, DAG generation, high-level planning.

Task Decomposition Layer

Per-node atomic reasoning, structured intent generation, validation.

Executor Layer

Executes intents, handles retries, ensures idempotency.

Storage & Logging

DAG store (graph DB or JSON)

Task store

Execution logs

Validator / Schema Layer

Ensures outputs conform to expected schema.

Prevents malformed or unsafe operations.

Monitoring & Replay

Replay DAGs for debugging, analysis, or auditing.

Step-level monitoring of execution results.

8. Key Insights
LLMs are treated purely as reasoning engines, not operators.

DAG + atomic step abstraction enables modular, auditable workflows.

Minimal context per step balances token efficiency with deterministic reasoning.

External executor ensures safety, reliability, and observability.

Approach scales naturally to large, complex problems and multi-agent orchestration.

If you want, I can also produce a layered conceptual diagram showing internal data flow, validation, and context isolation, which makes the system even clearer for research presentations. This would be more technical than the high-level workflow above.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
nah this is junk. how would documentations be added. 
ChatGPT said:
Ah! Now we’re talking about documentation integration, which is actually crucial for a reasoning-only LLM orchestration system. Let’s rethink how it fits without polluting the LLMs’ minimal context principle.

Here’s a conceptual approach:

1. Documentation Sources
Documentation can be any structured or semi-structured reference the LLMs may consult:

Static documentation: API specs, tool manuals, process guides.

Internal knowledge: Previous DAGs, executed tasks, historical results.

Dynamic references: System-generated reports, logs, or external data sources.

2. Where Documentation Fits
There are two main layers for docs:

A. Strategy LLM Layer
Docs are used to inform high-level planning.

Example: API capabilities, tool constraints, regulatory requirements.

LLM sees a summary of relevant documentation, not all of it.

Output: DAG nodes may include links to documentation or rationale for auditability.

B. Task Decomposer Layer
Docs guide atomic step generation.

LLM sees:

Relevant docs for this node (e.g., “how to call this API safely”).

Previously validated schemas or best practices.

Output: Steps can include references to documentation for each action.
Example: step metadata:

action_type: API_CALL
target: /users
parameters: {…}
documentation_link: https://internal.docs/api/users
3. Documentation Storage / Indexing
Doc Store: central repository of all documentation, indexed for retrieval.

Doc Retriever: fetches only relevant snippets for each LLM interaction.

Validation: ensures the LLM references correct docs when producing atomic steps.

This allows LLMs to reason using minimal context while maintaining traceability and accuracy.

4. Benefits of This Approach
Traceability: every step or DAG node can point to documentation that justifies it.

Auditability: reviewers can see which documents influenced reasoning.

Token efficiency: only relevant sections of documentation are fed to LLMs.

Separation of concerns: documentation informs reasoning, execution remains external.

              +----------------+
Doc Retriever feeds only relevant references to Strategy and Task LLMs.

All nodes and atomic steps can optionally store links to documentation for traceability.

If you want, I can also propose a structure for integrating documentation directly into DAG nodes and steps in a way that makes it searchable, linkable, and versioned, while still keeping LLM context minimal. This is usually where most frameworks fail—they either overload LLMs or lose traceability.

Do you want me to outline that?

You said:
how is that supposed to work. how does the docs work? are there open source tools for this? how do huge docs like for c# be handled
ChatGPT said:
Ah, now we’re getting into the practical realities of integrating documentation into an LLM orchestration workflow. Let’s break it down carefully.

1. How Documentation Works in This Framework
The key idea: LLMs don’t read everything—they only see what’s relevant. Large documentation is never fed whole; it’s retrieved and summarized per task.

Workflow for Documentation Usage:

Document Ingestion / Indexing

All documentation (APIs, SDKs, guides) is stored in a structured, searchable format.

Large docs are chunked (paragraphs, sections, or function-level chunks).

Each chunk gets metadata:

Topic / API / class name

URL or internal reference

Version or timestamp

Retrieval at Runtime

When the Strategy LLM or Task Decomposer needs context:

They provide a query or task description to a document retriever.

Only relevant chunks are returned.

Minimal context principle: LLM only sees these snippets.

Summarization / Context Condensation

Optionally, a separate LLM or tool summarizes or compresses large chunks into key points.

Only the compressed, relevant knowledge is fed to the reasoning LLM.

Documentation Links in DAG / Steps

DAG nodes and atomic steps can store references to original docs.

This ensures traceability for reviewers, audits, or later replay.

2. Handling Huge Docs (e.g., C# docs, SDKs)
Challenges:

Microsoft’s C# documentation is gigabytes of HTML.

Feeding it to an LLM in full is impossible.

Solutions:

Chunking & Embedding

Break docs into logical units (methods, classes, namespaces).

Convert each chunk into a vector embedding.

Use semantic search to retrieve only relevant chunks per query.

Vector Databases

Open-source tools: Weaviate, Milvus, FAISS, Chroma.

Store embeddings and metadata.

At runtime, query relevant sections using semantic similarity.

On-Demand Summarization

Retrieved chunks are optionally summarized by an LLM.

Only condensed summaries are fed to the reasoning LLM.

Versioning

Include doc version or release info in metadata to avoid stale references.

DAG nodes can point to specific versions.

3. Open Source Tools for Documentation Retrieval
Purpose	Tools / Libraries
Semantic Search / Embedding	FAISS, Milvus, Weaviate, Chroma, Pinecone (hosted)
LLM Summarization	LangChain (for pipelines), LlamaIndex, Haystack
HTML / PDF / Markdown Parsing	BeautifulSoup, PyMuPDF, markdown parsers
DAG / Workflow Storage	NetworkX (Python), Neo4j, Dgraph
Example Flow:

Chunk docs → create embeddings → store in vector DB.

Task LLM asks: “How do I call HttpClient.GetAsync safely?”

Retriever finds relevant C# docs chunk → optional summarization → feed to LLM.

LLM outputs atomic step referencing the snippet or documentation link.

4. Conceptual Diagram: Documentation Integration

             v
     +-----------------+
     | Executor Layer  |
     +-----------------+
LLMs never see the entire docs.

Only relevant chunks are retrieved per task.

Steps can reference docs for auditability.

5. Advantages
Works with huge documentation sets.

Keeps LLM context minimal.

Ensures traceable, reproducible reasoning.

Supports updating docs without retraining LLMs.

Fully compatible with multi-language or SDK-heavy systems like .NET.

If you want, I can create a detailed workflow for LLM + Doc Retriever + Executor, showing exactly how a C# API call would go from user query → reasoning → DAG node → atomic step → executor, which is often where most systems fail.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
do these tools exist for typescript?
ChatGPT said:
Yes — the concept of embedding, semantic search, and documentation retrieval exists for TypeScript too, though the ecosystem is slightly different than Python. Let’s break it down carefully.

1. Documentation Sources in TypeScript
Official TypeScript docs: typescriptlang.org/docs

API docs for libraries: e.g., Node.js, React, Angular, NestJS, or other NPM packages.

Local project typings: .d.ts files and JSDoc comments.

Markdown-based internal docs: guides, READMEs, or RFCs.

Large codebases like React or Node can be hundreds of MBs of doc + typings, so you need a chunked, retrievable approach.

2. Open Source Tools / Libraries for TypeScript Documentation Retrieval
A. Vector Database / Embeddings
LangChain.js (JavaScript/TypeScript version)

Can embed docs and query them.

Weaviate (TypeScript client available)

Chroma (via REST API or unofficial JS clients)

FAISS (via Python microservice, then queried from TS)

Pinecone (hosted, has JS/TS SDK)

B. Parsing / Chunking Docs
Marked: Markdown parser for Node.js → splits README/docs.

TypeDoc: Generates JSON from TypeScript projects → easy to embed.

ts-morph: Can extract detailed AST + documentation from TypeScript projects.

jsdom / cheerio: HTML parsing for web-based documentation.

C. Summarization / LLM integration
LangChain.js: orchestration, chunk retrieval, summarization pipelines.

LlamaIndex / GPT Index: can be integrated via REST API or Node.js wrapper.

3. Practical Workflow in TypeScript
Ingest docs

Parse Markdown docs, JSDoc comments, .d.ts files.

Chunk by class/function/method.

Store in vector DB with metadata: module, class, method, file path.

Generate embeddings

OpenAI embeddings, Cohere, or local embedding models.

Store embeddings in vector DB.

Query at reasoning time

LLM Task Decomposer receives a node to reason about.

Sends a query to vector DB: “How do I call fetchData() in this module?”

Retrieve top N relevant chunks (e.g., docs + JSDoc comments).

Optionally summarize.

Feed to LLM for atomic step generation.

Output

Step references documentation chunks for traceability.

Executor later performs actions using actual TypeScript APIs.

4. Advantages in TypeScript
Works with typed codebases: .d.ts + JSDoc provide precise hints.

Can handle large multi-package projects (e.g., monorepos).

Compatible with multi-layer orchestration:

Strategy LLM → Task LLM → Executor.

Supports auditable references: each step points to exact TS doc location.

✅ Summary:
Yes, open-source tools exist to make documentation retrievable for TypeScript, including:

TypeDoc / ts-morph for parsing.

Vector DBs (Weaviate, FAISS, Chroma) for semantic search.

LangChain.js or LlamaIndex for orchestration and summarization pipelines.

This allows the same minimal-context, LLM-only reasoning framework used in Python or C# to work in TypeScript projects.

If you want, I can draft a concrete example of TypeScript project documentation flow, showing exactly how an LLM would generate DAG nodes referencing TypeScript docs and then produce atomic steps, so it’s easier to visualize.

Do you want me to do that?

which one does Cursor the ide tool use?
ChatGPT said:
Cursor, the AI-powered IDE, utilizes Turbopuffer as its vector database for storing codebase embeddings. These embeddings are generated from semantically chunked code snippets and are optimized for fast similarity search across millions of code chunks. This approach enables Cursor to provide intelligent code completions, refactorings, and chat-based interactions without storing raw code on the server. 
Cursor
+1

Previously, Cursor employed Pinecone for storing embeddings of public web documents fetched via the @Web feature. However, this is distinct from the vector database used for codebase embeddings. 
Cursor - Community Forum

It's worth noting that Cursor has experimented with different vector databases over time. As of mid-2025, Turbopuffer is the primary vector database in use for codebase embeddings. However, there have been discussions within the Cursor community about potentially moving away from vector search for code entirely, possibly favoring lexical search methods. 
TigerData

In summary, while Cursor has explored various vector databases, Turbopuffer currently serves as the primary storage solution for codebase embeddings, facilitating Cursor's advanced AI-powered coding features.

You said:
what are non vector solutions for docs storage
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely — vector databases are just one approach for document retrieval and reasoning with LLMs. There are several non-vector solutions for storing and retrieving documentation or large corpora. These rely on traditional text search, structured storage, or hybrid approaches. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. Full-Text Search Databases
These store documents as plain text and support keyword-based or Boolean searches. They do not use embeddings, but are fast and scalable.

Tool	Type	Pros	Cons	Use Cases
Elasticsearch	Distributed full-text search engine	Mature, scalable, powerful query DSL, supports indexing, filters, highlights	No semantic search; requires careful indexing	Large documentation sets, API docs, internal knowledge bases
OpenSearch	Open-source fork of Elasticsearch	Same as Elasticsearch, open-source	Same limitations	Internal docs, logs, tutorials
Solr	Apache full-text search engine	Highly customizable, supports faceted search	Older ecosystem, less maintained	Legacy systems with structured document sets
SQLite FTS / Postgres FTS	Embedded/full-text search in relational DB	Lightweight, embeddable	Less powerful than Elasticsearch, limited semantic features	Local doc storage for small-medium projects
2. Structured Document Databases
Document Stores (JSON / BSON): e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB

Store docs in structured form with metadata.

Can index fields for search, including nested objects.

Pros: flexible schema, easy to store versioned docs, supports queries by metadata.

Cons: no semantic search out-of-the-box; search is keyword-based.

3. Code / Typed Doc-Specific Indexers
For large codebases (TypeScript, C#, etc.):

TypeDoc + ts-morph + JSON storage

TypeDoc can produce a JSON representation of the entire API, with method/class docs.

Store JSON in a document DB (MongoDB, SQLite, or even local JSON files).

Retrieval is structured (query by class/method name) rather than semantic.

AST-Based Indexing

Parse code + docs into Abstract Syntax Trees.

Store in a DB keyed by identifiers and hierarchical paths.

Allows precise retrieval of documentation by symbol.

4. Hybrid Search Approaches (Non-Vector)
Lexical + Metadata Search

Use full-text search (Elasticsearch, Postgres FTS) combined with metadata filters.

Example: “Find all methods in module X that take a string and return a promise.”

Document Chunking + Retrieval

Large docs are split into logical chunks (sections, classes, methods).

Chunks are indexed by keywords, headings, and IDs.

LLM retrieves relevant chunks via keyword or structured query, not embedding similarity.

5. Advantages of Non-Vector Approaches
Simpler to implement; no embeddings required.

Predictable and deterministic retrieval (no similarity scoring ambiguity).

Works well for structured APIs where semantic similarity is less critical.

Often more lightweight, embeddable, and cheaper than vector DBs.

6. Tradeoffs vs Vector Approaches
Aspect	Vector DB	Non-Vector Search
Retrieval	Semantic similarity	Keyword / Boolean / structured
Flexibility	High (can retrieve synonyms, paraphrases)	Low (matches exact text or metadata)
Storage	Embeddings + metadata	Text / JSON / structured fields
Complexity	Higher (requires embedding models, vector DB)	Lower (traditional DBs, simpler indexing)
Scaling	Good for very large corpora with semantic queries	Very good for structured docs, limited semantic queries
✅ Summary:
Non-vector solutions are usually full-text search engines or structured document stores, optionally combined with metadata indexing or code-specific JSON/AST storage. They are especially suitable for large API docs like C# or TypeScript, where you can retrieve relevant sections deterministically without relying on embeddings.

If you want, I can draw a conceptual diagram showing how a non-vector documentation retrieval system could integrate with your LLM DAG orchestration, similar to the vector-based flow we discussed earlier. This would show how docs can feed reasoning without embeddings.

Do you want me to do that?

ChatGPT said:
Perfect — here’s a clean, self-contained master prompt you can use to continue your investigation or research in a new chat or tool.

It captures everything we discussed — your original idea for a new LLM tool, the documentation and orchestration aspects, and the storage/retrieval options (vector and non-vector).

🧭 Master Research Prompt: LLM Orchestration + Documentation Intelligence System
Goal:
Design or research a new LLM tool or framework that enables dynamic orchestration of workflows (DAG-style) where multiple LLM “nodes” or agents collaborate on complex reasoning, documentation lookup, and tool usage — with a focus on developer-oriented documentation systems (like C#, TypeScript, etc.) and local or embeddable architectures.

Core Concept
The tool is a workflow orchestrator for LLMs, where each node (or “agent”) can:

Execute reasoning steps.

Query local or external documentation.

Chain outputs into subsequent steps.

Use structured data or external tools when needed.

Think of it as a LLM-native runtime or “LangChain/AutoGPT successor” — but with first-class support for:

Document retrieval (both vector and non-vector)

Structured reasoning flow

Explainable and deterministic orchestration

Integration with development workflows (especially TypeScript and C#)

Documentation Handling
Investigate how documentation can be integrated into this system:

Large structured API docs like those for C# or TypeScript.

Automatic parsing, linking, and retrieval for functions, types, and modules.

Support for versioned and contextual docs (e.g., framework versions, project-specific notes).

The docs system should be:

Efficient for large corpora (tens of thousands of pages/classes).

Queryable by LLMs for contextual reasoning.

Extensible for both vector (semantic) and non-vector (structured/text) retrieval.

Storage and Retrieval Options
🧠 Vector-based (semantic search)
Examples: SQLite extensions (pgvector, chroma, LanceDB, Weaviate, Milvus, Qdrant)

Use embeddings to retrieve semantically relevant chunks.

Suited for natural language and unstructured text.

⚙️ Non-vector-based (structured or keyword retrieval)
Full-text search engines: Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Solr, Postgres FTS, SQLite FTS.

Document stores: MongoDB, CouchDB — store structured JSON or AST-based data.

Code-specific approaches:

Generate documentation trees using TypeDoc (for TS) or DocFX (for C#).

Store symbol metadata in JSON or SQL.

Use keyword/identifier-based lookups instead of semantic search.

These non-vector systems allow deterministic retrieval and better alignment with code-level queries (e.g. “find all methods in namespace X returning Promise<void>”).

Embeddable / Local Options
Explore embedded or lightweight databases for local LLM dev environments:

SQLite + FTS5 (non-vector)

SQLite + pgvector or LanceDB (vector)

DuckDB or Turso for analytics-style hybrid storage

Determine whether existing tools like Cursor IDE or GitHub Copilot use embedded vector stores or external APIs for context caching and retrieval (Cursor likely uses a mix of local cache + hosted vector index).

System Architecture Goals
Support modular DAG workflows (data → reasoning → action → result).

Enable local-first, offline-capable dev environment integration.

Provide document intelligence — the ability for the LLM to “understand” APIs and project structures via indexed docs.

Allow both vector (semantic) and non-vector (structured/textual) retrieval pipelines.

Enable users or developers to extend or inject their own doc sources easily.

Research Tasks / Next Steps
Investigate existing open-source tools for LLM orchestration:

LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, MemGPT, AutoGen, OpenDevin.

Check if any support hybrid doc retrieval or embeddable workflows.

Explore documentation frameworks and their data outputs:

TypeDoc (TS), DocFX (C#), Sphinx (Python), Doxygen (C++).

How they structure docs and whether they’re machine-readable.

Compare vector vs non-vector retrieval for doc-heavy reasoning tasks.

Latency, accuracy, determinism, and scalability.

Look for embeddable or hybrid DBs that support local doc intelligence.

Examples: SQLite FTS5, ChromaDB, LanceDB, Qdrant-local.

Identify gaps that could inspire a new developer-focused LLM orchestration platform that:

Understands project code and docs.

Operates locally or in hybrid mode.

Offers explainable reasoning and tooling orchestration.

Framing Prompt for Deep Research or Prototyping
“I’m researching how to design an LLM orchestration tool that integrates documentation retrieval, both vector-based and non-vector-based, for programming languages like TypeScript and C#. I want to understand existing solutions, open-source frameworks, and architecture options for building a local or embeddable system that supports structured reasoning workflows and doc-aware intelligence.”

Would you like me to add a “follow-up investigation section” at the end — e.g. suggested search queries or next prompt templates (for digging deeper into each component)? That can make it easier for you to continue exploring each layer (storage, doc parsing, orchestration, etc.) systematically.

🧭 Master Research Prompt: LLM Orchestration + Documentation Intelligence System
Goal:
Design or research a new LLM tool or framework that enables dynamic orchestration of workflows (DAG-style) where multiple LLM “nodes” or agents collaborate on complex reasoning, documentation lookup, and tool usage — with a focus on developer-oriented documentation systems (like C# and TypeScript) and local or embeddable architectures.

1. Core Concept
The envisioned system is a workflow orchestrator for LLMs, where each node (or “agent”) can:

Execute reasoning steps.

Query local or external documentation.

Chain outputs into subsequent steps.

Use structured data or external tools when needed.

It acts as an LLM-native runtime — a successor to LangChain or AutoGPT — with first-class support for:

Documentation retrieval (vector and non-vector).

Structured reasoning flow (DAG orchestration).

Explainable, auditable workflows.

Local-first developer integration for TypeScript, C#, and similar ecosystems.

2. Documentation Handling
Explore how documentation can be integrated into this reasoning system:

Handle large, structured API docs such as:

C# XML documentation / DocFX outputs

TypeScript’s TypeDoc JSON AST

Enable automatic parsing, linking, and retrieval for functions, types, and modules.

Support versioned, contextual, and project-specific documentation.

Requirements for the documentation subsystem:
Efficient with large corpora (e.g., tens of thousands of symbols or pages).

Queryable by LLMs for contextual reasoning.

Compatible with both vector and non-vector retrieval pipelines.

3. Storage and Retrieval Options
🧠 Vector-Based Retrieval (Semantic Search)
Use embeddings to find semantically similar content.
Good for natural language queries or unstructured text.

Examples:

Chroma

LanceDB

Qdrant

Weaviate

Milvus

SQLite extensions (e.g., pgvector)

Strengths:

Flexible and language-agnostic.

Works well for fuzzy matches or user questions.

Weaknesses:

Requires embedding maintenance.

Harder to guarantee deterministic results.

⚙️ Non-Vector-Based Retrieval (Structured / Keyword Search)
Relies on indexing, identifiers, or structured metadata rather than embeddings.
Useful for code-oriented or symbolic lookups.

Examples:

Full-text search: Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Solr, Postgres FTS, SQLite FTS5

Document stores: MongoDB, CouchDB (for JSON-based doc trees)

Static doc parsers: TypeDoc (TS), DocFX (C#), Doxygen (C++), Sphinx (Python)

Advantages:

Deterministic, reproducible results.

Better alignment with code-level queries (e.g., “find all methods in namespace X returning Promise<void>”).

Possible Hybrid Approach:

Use non-vector indexing for symbol lookup, and

vector embeddings for semantic cross-references or “explain in plain English” style queries.

4. Embeddable / Local Options
For local-first or offline environments, prioritize lightweight databases that can run in an IDE or devcontainer.

Category	Examples	Notes
Non-Vector Embedded	SQLite + FTS5	Ideal for keyword search and local doc storage.
Hybrid (Vector + FTS)	SQLite + pgvector, LanceDB	Combines semantic and lexical search.
Analytics / Query-Oriented	DuckDB, Turso	Can handle hybrid structured + unstructured data.
Cursor IDE Example:
Cursor uses Turbopuffer as its main vector database for codebase embeddings.

Previously used Pinecone for public web document embeddings.

Recent trends suggest exploration of non-vector search for deterministic code context retrieval.

5. System Architecture Goals
Support modular DAG workflows (data → reasoning → action → result).

Be auditable and replayable — every reasoning step is inspectable.

Enable local-first, offline-capable development.

Provide documentation intelligence:

Understand APIs, projects, and code symbols.

Retrieve or link definitions across doc sources.

Allow vector and non-vector retrieval layers to coexist.

Let developers inject or extend documentation sources easily.

6. Research Tasks / Next Steps
Investigate orchestration frameworks:
LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, MemGPT, AutoGen, OpenDevin, LangGraph.
→ Which support hybrid retrieval or embeddable workflows?

Explore doc generators and outputs:
TypeDoc (TypeScript), DocFX (C#), Sphinx (Python), Doxygen (C++).
→ How are docs structured? JSON, YAML, XML?

Compare retrieval methods:
Vector vs non-vector — accuracy, latency, determinism, scalability.

Evaluate embeddable/local databases:
SQLite + FTS5, LanceDB, Qdrant-local, Turso, DuckDB.

Identify design gaps:

A doc-aware LLM orchestration platform that is:

Developer-native (integrates with editors).

Local or hybrid (privacy-friendly).

Explainable (auditable DAGs).

Modular (Strategy LLM → Task LLM → Executor).

7. Framing Prompt for Deep Research
“I’m researching how to design an LLM orchestration tool that integrates documentation retrieval, both vector-based and non-vector-based, for programming languages like TypeScript and C#.

ChatGPT said:
Got it — here’s a concise Markdown version of your master research prompt, stripped of tooling and storage details, focusing only on conceptual architecture and reasoning flow:

🧩 Research Prompt: LLM Workflow & Documentation Reasoning Framework
Goal:
Design a conceptual system where LLMs reason about complex problems through a structured workflow, separating planning, decomposition, and execution, with integrated access to documentation for informed reasoning.

Core Idea
The system uses two LLMs:

Strategy Generator — analyzes a natural-language problem and produces a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of reasoning tasks.

Task Decomposer — expands each DAG node into atomic steps and specifies what intents or actions are required (but never executes them).

An Executor Layer handles all actual operations, following validated intents from the LLMs.

Documentation Integration
The system should connect to a documentation knowledge layer that allows LLMs to reason accurately about APIs, types, and functions.

Docs must be:

Queryable for context at reasoning time.

Linked to problem domains or DAG nodes.

Stored and versioned in a structured format for replay and audit.

Design Goals
Strict separation:
Strategy → Decomposition → Execution

Each reasoning step has minimal context (token-efficient).

Replayable and auditable DAGs.

Structured, validated intents before any execution.

LLMs never directly call tools — they only plan and reason.

Key Research Focus
Investigate how to architect an LLM reasoning system that generates and manages structured workflows (DAGs), integrates a documentation knowledge layer, and maintains strict separation between reasoning, planning, and execution — enabling reproducibility, minimal context usage, and explainable outputs.

Would you like a slightly expanded variant (around 2× longer) that includes the motivation and advantages over existing LLM orchestration systems (e.g., LangGraph, AutoGen) without adding any implementation detail?

You said:
no you changed the requirements again. its not 2 llms. here is the original prompt You are a system architect and researcher for advanced LLM orchestration.

Your task is to design a conceptual framework for a tool that allows LLMs to reason about complex problems via a structured workflow, while **never executing tools themselves**. You must produce a detailed, high-level design and analysis.

Requirements:

1. **Workflow Overview**
   - One LLM (Strategy Generator) analyzes a natural-language problem and produces a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** as a plan. Nodes represent tasks; edges represent dependencies.
   - A second LLM (Task Decomposer) takes each node and breaks it into **atomic steps**, indicating what **tools or actions** will be required, but **not performing them**.
   - Each LLM interaction should receive **minimal context**: only the necessary prior outputs and relevant static information to perform reasoning for that task.
   - The tool layer / executor is responsible for performing all real operations (read, write, replace, API calls, etc.) based on the LLM-indicated intents.

2. **Design Goals**
   - Minimize LLM token usage by isolating context per step.
   - Ensure LLMs only reason and plan; execution is separated.
   - DAG must be replayable, auditable, and maintainable.
   - Intent outputs from LLMs should be **structured and validated** before execution.
   - Provide clear separation of concerns: Strategy LLM → Task LLM → Executor.

3. **Comparison with Existing Tools**
   - Existing frameworks (Teola, AutoGen, LangGraph, LangDAG, Action Engine) partially overlap:
     - Multi-agent orchestration.
     - DAG-based execution.
     - Structured outputs for tool calls.
   - Your design differs because:
     - The DAG is **LLM-generated** as a first step.
     - Each node runs with **strict minimal context**.
     - LLMs never execute tools, only indicate intents.
     - Execution is fully handled externally and validated.

4. **Deliverables**
   - High-level conceptual design for such a system.
   - Explanation of the workflow (Strategy LLM → Task LLM → Executor).
   - Notes on advantages of this approach vs existing frameworks.
   - Optional: Suggest components, layers, and data structures at a conceptual level (no code needed).

Constraints:
- Focus on reasoning flow, DAG orchestration, intent separation, and context optimization.
- Avoid specifying code or implementation details.
- Keep the description clear for technical and research audiences.
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — here’s a clean, concise Markdown version of your original orchestration research prompt, rewritten for reuse or continuation.
It keeps all your original logic intact, with no tooling, no storage options, and no additions — just the conceptual architecture and reasoning scope.

🧠 Research Prompt: Structured LLM Workflow & Reasoning Framework
Role:
You are a system architect and researcher for advanced LLM orchestration.

Objective
Design a conceptual framework for a tool that enables LLMs to reason about complex problems through a structured workflow, while never executing tools themselves.

The system must produce a high-level, auditable plan and clearly separate reasoning, planning, and execution layers.

Requirements
1. Workflow Overview
Strategy Generator (LLM 1)
Analyzes a natural-language problem and produces a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representing the overall reasoning plan.

Nodes: tasks or reasoning units.

Edges: dependencies between tasks.

Task Decomposer (LLM 2)
Processes each DAG node and breaks it into atomic steps, defining what tools or actions would be required — but does not execute them.

Context Management:
Each LLM interaction receives only the minimal required context — prior outputs and relevant static data — to optimize token usage and reasoning clarity.

Executor Layer:
Performs all real operations (API calls, reads, writes, transformations, etc.) based on validated intents provided by the LLMs.

2. Design Goals
Context Efficiency:
Isolate reasoning per node to minimize token usage.

Strict Separation of Concerns:
Strategy LLM → Task LLM → Executor.

Replayable & Auditable Workflows:
Every reasoning step (DAG node and intent) must be recorded and reproducible.

Structured, Validated Intents:
LLMs output structured instructions that are verified before execution.

Reasoning-Only LLMs:
LLMs plan and infer but never perform real actions.

3. Differentiation from Existing Frameworks
While tools like Teola, AutoGen, LangGraph, LangDAG, and Action Engine handle multi-agent or DAG orchestration, this framework differs because:

The DAG is LLM-generated as the first reasoning artifact.

Each node runs with strict minimal context to control reasoning boundaries.

LLMs never call or execute tools — they only describe intents.

The Executor validates and performs actions externally, ensuring reproducibility and safety.

4. Deliverables
A high-level conceptual design of the system architecture.

A detailed workflow explanation (Strategy LLM → Task LLM → Executor).

Analytical notes on advantages vs existing orchestration frameworks.

(Optional) Conceptual layers or data structures — without code or implementation specifics.

Constraints
Focus on reasoning flow, DAG orchestration, intent separation, and context optimization.

Avoid code, tool names, or implementation details.

Keep the design clear, analytical, and suitable for research or architectural analysis.

Would you like me to make a follow-up version that frames this same prompt for LLM-based meta-research (e.g. “analyze the viability, gaps, and research directions for such a framework”)? It would be useful for continuing this work in a new investigation thread.

You said:
where is the documentation? why are you once again too verbose. 
ChatGPT said:
Got it — here’s the tight, minimal Markdown version that includes the documentation requirement and keeps only the essential concepts.

🧩 Research Prompt: LLM Workflow & Documentation Framework
Design a conceptual framework where LLMs reason about complex problems via a structured workflow, while never executing tools themselves.

Core Workflow
Strategy Generator (LLM 1) → creates a DAG of tasks and dependencies.

Task Decomposer (LLM 2) → expands each node into atomic steps and intended tool actions (no execution).

Executor Layer → validates and performs actions based on LLM intents.

Documentation Layer → provides structured, queryable access to project or language docs so reasoning steps can reference accurate definitions, APIs, and examples.

Design Goals
LLMs only plan and reason, never execute.

Each step runs with minimal context.

DAGs are replayable and auditable.

Intents are structured and validated before execution.

Documentation is stored and linked for contextual reasoning (not retrieved via the model itself).

Key Difference
Unlike existing orchestration frameworks, the DAG is generated by the LLM, documentation is a first-class reasoning source, and execution is external.

That’s the compact, complete version — under 120 words, with documentation properly integrated.
