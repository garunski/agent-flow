üß© Research Prompt: LLM Workflow & Documentation Framework

Design a conceptual framework where LLMs reason about complex problems via a structured workflow, while never executing tools themselves.

Core Workflow

Strategy Generator (LLM 1) ‚Üí creates a DAG of tasks and dependencies.

Task Decomposer (LLM 2) ‚Üí expands each node into atomic steps and intended tool actions (no execution).

Executor Layer ‚Üí validates and performs actions based on LLM intents.

Documentation Layer ‚Üí provides structured, queryable access to project or language docs so reasoning steps can reference accurate definitions, APIs, and examples.

Design Goals

LLMs only plan and reason, never execute.

Each step runs with minimal context.

DAGs are replayable and auditable.

Intents are structured and validated before execution.

Documentation is stored and linked for contextual reasoning (not retrieved via the model itself).

Key Difference

Unlike existing orchestration frameworks, the DAG is generated by the LLM, documentation is a first-class reasoning source, and execution is external.

Here‚Äôs a clear, structured conceptual framework based on your research prompt. I‚Äôve distilled it into a concise, high-level architecture and workflow design suitable for LLM orchestration research.

üß© LLM Workflow & Documentation Framework
1. Overview
The framework enables LLMs to reason about complex problems without executing tools themselves. It separates planning, decomposition, documentation referencing, and execution, ensuring auditable, reproducible workflows.

Core Principle:

LLMs generate structured reasoning and action plans; execution and side effects happen in external, validated systems.

2. Core Components
1. Strategy Generator (LLM 1)
Role: Produces a high-level plan for solving the problem.

Output: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of tasks with dependencies.

Characteristics:

Tasks are abstract.

Dependencies capture execution order and prerequisites.

DAG is serializable, replayable, and auditable.

2. Task Decomposer (LLM 2)
Role: Breaks each DAG node into fine-grained, atomic steps.

Output:

Step-by-step actions.

Intended tool interactions (purely declarative, not executed).

Contextual references to documentation (APIs, definitions, examples).

Characteristics:

Each step is minimal and self-contained.

Steps include structured metadata: input, output, dependencies, tool intents.

3. Documentation Layer
Role: Serves as the authoritative knowledge source for reasoning.

Features:

Queryable knowledge base (e.g., project docs, API specs, tutorials).

Linked to tasks and steps for LLM reference.

Ensures reasoning is grounded in accurate, external knowledge rather than hallucinated.

4. Executor Layer (External)
Role: Executes the planned workflow based on LLM-generated intents.

Characteristics:

Validates intents before execution.

Handles tool interaction, I/O, and side effects.

Provides feedback for potential re-planning.

Fully decoupled from LLMs.

3. Workflow
Problem Definition ‚Üí Strategy Generation

Input: Problem statement + optional constraints.

LLM 1 generates DAG of high-level tasks.

Task Decomposition

LLM 2 expands each DAG node into atomic, structured steps.

Steps reference the Documentation Layer for context.

Intent Validation

Structured intents are validated for completeness and correctness.

Execution

Executor layer performs actions.

Results are logged and fed back if needed.

Audit & Replay

Entire DAG, decomposition, and execution logs are stored.

Reproducible reasoning and traceable outcomes.

4. Design Principles
LLMs do not execute tools. Planning only.

Minimal context per step. Keeps reasoning atomic and auditable.

DAGs are replayable and auditable. Facilitates debugging and verification.

Structured intents. Execution is deterministic and validated.

Documentation-driven reasoning. LLMs reference external docs, not memory hallucinations.

5. Key Differentiators
Feature	Existing Orchestration	Proposed Framework
DAG Generation	Predefined or rule-based	LLM-generated dynamically
Execution	LLM-triggered or automated	External executor only
Documentation	Optional or ad-hoc	First-class, queryable reference for reasoning
Replay & Audit	Often limited	Native DAG replay, step-level logging
Tool Interaction	Often executed by LLM	LLM expresses intent only; execution separated
6. Potential Extensions
Feedback Loops: Executor logs can update DAG or steps for improved reasoning.

Dynamic Documentation Updates: Docs can evolve and influence future planning.

Multi-LLM Coordination: Assign multiple LLMs specialized for different domains or tasks.

Simulated Execution: Optional dry-run environments to test intents without real-world effects.

This framework turns LLMs into ‚Äúreasoning engines‚Äù while keeping execution strictly external and verifiable. The separation of planning, decomposition, and documentation referencing enables complex problem-solving that is auditable, reproducible, and safe.

If you want, I can also draw a clean architecture diagram showing LLM layers, documentation, DAG, and executor for visual clarity. It would be easy to reference in a research document.

Do you want me to create that diagram?
