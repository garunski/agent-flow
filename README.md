## Multi-Agent Agentic Development System

### Overview
An AI-powered software development orchestration platform that separates predictive intelligence from tool execution through a multi-agent architecture. The system automates complex development workflows by coordinating specialized agents that predict necessary actions while a central engine handles all actual tool execution.

### Core Architecture

**Agent Layer (Prediction Only)**
- Specialized agents analyze requirements and predict necessary actions
- Agents include: Analyzer, Documenter, Strategist, Schema Designer, Implementer, Checker, and Verifier
- Each agent suggests appropriate tools and parameters but never executes them directly

**Execution Engine (Tool Orchestration)**
- Central engine receives agent predictions and executes all tool operations
- Maintains separation between decision-making and action execution
- Manages context storage and feedback loops between iterations

### Key Capabilities

**Iterative Development Workflow**
- Handles complex, multi-step development tasks from requirements to deployment
- Automatically detects gaps (missing tests, incomplete documentation, overlooked dependencies)
- Self-corrects through iterative feedback loops and plan revisions
- Supports full repository re-analysis when persistent issues are detected

**Comprehensive Tool Integration**
- Code analysis and manipulation (scanning, editing, creating files)
- Documentation retrieval and curation (web search, storage)
- Database operations (schema migrations, logging)
- Validation and security (test runners, security scanners, audit reporting)
- Execution and verification (syntax checking, test execution)

**Context-Aware Learning**
- Stores analysis context for reuse across iterations
- Improves predictions based on previous execution outcomes
- Maintains audit trails of all changes and validations

### Use Cases
Ideal for automating end-to-end feature implementation including authentication systems, API integrations, database migrations, and other complex development tasks requiring coordination across multiple domains (code, documentation, testing, security).
