## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture Components

### 1. **Strategy Generator Layer (LLM-1: Planner)**

**Responsibilities:**
- Generate high-level directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from problem statements
- Identify task dependencies and parallelization opportunities
- Produce serializable, replayable execution plans

**Output Specifications:**
```json
{
  "dag_id": "unique_identifier",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "task_id": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "dependencies": ["task_id"],
      "parallelizable": boolean,
      "estimated_complexity": "low|medium|high",
      "required_capabilities": ["capability_tags"]
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "planning_timestamp": "ISO8601",
    "confidence_score": float,
    "alternative_approaches": []
  }
}
```

**Research Focus:**
- What prompting strategies optimize DAG generation quality?
- How do we measure plan optimality (execution time, resource usage, robustness)?
- Can we incorporate cost-benefit analysis in planning?

---

### 2. **Task Decomposer Layer (LLM-2: Decomposer)**

**Responsibilities:**
- Break DAG nodes into atomic, executable steps
- Generate **declarative tool intents** (not execution commands)
- Reference documentation for grounded reasoning
- Produce structured step metadata

**Output Specifications:**
```json
{
  "task_id": "parent_task_reference",
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_id": "string",
      "action": "declarative_description",
      "tool_intent": {
        "tool_name": "string",
        "operation": "string",
        "required_inputs": {},
        "expected_outputs": {},
        "validation_criteria": []
      },
      "documentation_references": ["doc_id"],
      "preconditions": [],
      "postconditions": [],
      "rollback_strategy": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Research Focus:**
- What defines "atomic" in different domains (code, data, research)?
- How do we prevent over-decomposition or under-decomposition?
- What metadata is essential for validation and debugging?

---

### 3. **Documentation Knowledge Layer**

**Architecture:**
- Vector database for semantic search (embeddings-based retrieval)
- Structured API specifications (OpenAPI, GraphQL schemas)
- Example repositories with annotated use cases
- Version-controlled knowledge base

**Features:**
- **Queryable interface** for LLMs during planning/decomposition
- **Confidence scoring** for retrieved documentation
- **Temporal validity** tracking (API versions, deprecated features)
- **Usage pattern mining** from historical successful plans

**Research Focus:**
- How should documentation be chunked for optimal retrieval?
- What role does RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) play in grounding?
- Can we auto-generate documentation from execution logs?

---

### 4. **Validation & Intent Verification Layer**

**Pre-Execution Validation:**
- **Syntactic validation**: Check intent structure completeness
- **Semantic validation**: Verify tool existence, parameter types
- **Dependency validation**: Ensure input availability from prior steps
- **Safety validation**: Check against prohibited operations
- **Resource validation**: Verify computational/API quota availability

**Validation Schema:**
```json
{
  "validation_result": {
    "is_valid": boolean,
    "checks_passed": [],
    "checks_failed": [
      {
        "check_type": "string",
        "severity": "error|warning",
        "message": "string",
        "suggested_fix": "string"
      }
    ],
    "approval_required": boolean
  }
}
```

**Research Focus:**
- Can LLMs perform self-validation of generated intents?
- What formal verification methods apply to LLM-generated plans?
- How do we balance safety with flexibility?

---

### 5. **Executor Layer (External System)**

**Characteristics:**
- **Strictly isolated** from LLM context
- Executes validated intents only
- Provides structured feedback for re-planning
- Implements sandboxing and rate limiting
- Logs all operations for audit trails

**Execution Feedback Loop:**
```json
{
  "step_id": "reference",
  "execution_status": "success|failure|partial",
  "outputs": {},
  "errors": [],
  "performance_metrics": {
    "duration_ms": int,
    "resources_used": {}
  },
  "side_effects": [],
  "requires_replan": boolean
}
```

**Research Focus:**
- When should execution failures trigger re-planning vs. rollback?
- How do we handle non-deterministic tool behavior?
- What observability metrics matter most?
