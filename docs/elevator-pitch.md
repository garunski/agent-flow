# Declarative LLM Orchestration: Elevator Pitch & Gap Analysis

## Tagline
Auditable plans, safer actions: LLMs that only think — never act.

## Elevator Pitch
Modern agent frameworks blur reasoning and execution, creating opaque behavior, security risk, and high cost. Our framework cleanly separates policy from mechanism: an LLM produces a declarative, platform‑neutral DAG (the plan), and a deterministic executor performs all actions after formal validation. Each step runs with minimal context sourced from a first‑class documentation layer, enabling explainable, replayable workflows with predictable cost and strong safety guarantees. The result is an enterprise‑grade orchestration system where plans are verified before any state mutation, execution is policy‑enforced and logged, and every outcome is traceable back to an immutable intent — ideal for regulated or high‑stakes environments.

## Problem
- Opaque, chat‑driven control flow undermines auditability and debugging.
- LLMs calling tools directly increase security exposure and cost.
- Context bloat degrades quality and drives latency/token spend.
- Documentation isn’t systematically integrated or verifiable.

## Solution (Summarized)
- Declarative IR/DAG as the canonical plan artifact generated by the LLM.
- Pre‑execution verification: schema/type rules, FQL‑style goal checks, calibrated confidence gates, dry‑run.
- Minimal context per node via selective retrieval/summarization; documentation as first‑class (OpenAPI/TypeDoc/DocFX aware).
- Policy‑enforced executor with safety/OOS checks; immutable intent ledger + execution log; checkpointing and saga compensation.

## Why Now
- Enterprise adoption demands auditability, safety, and reproducibility for AI systems.
- Maturing practices in structured outputs, RAG, and validation enable reliable planning without letting models execute.
- Costs and security incidents are pressuring teams to adopt deterministic, verifiable control planes.

## Differentiation
- LLM‑first, platform‑neutral DAG as the plan of record (not conversation).
- Strict separation: LLMs reason; executor acts — never the reverse.
- Formal verification gates before any state change.
- Documentation‑aware planning with structure‑preserving retrieval.
- Built‑in resilience (retries, compensation, dynamic but auditable DAG edits).

## Key Gaps & Risks (and Mitigations)
- FQL scope/authoring overhead: start with a constrained spec focused on target domains; provide templates and auto‑derived checks from requirements.
- Retrieval quality for structured docs: implement structure‑aware parsers (OpenAPI/TypeDoc/DocFX) and evaluate with retrieval precision/recall; fall back to lexical search for symbols.
- Confidence calibration reliability: use isotonic regression or ensemble scoring on held‑out tasks; gate low‑confidence plans to HITL.
- Dynamic DAG restructuring governance: restrict replanning to localized sub‑DAGs with diff‑based audit; require verifier re‑approval.
- Executor safety policy design: begin with an allow‑list registry, OOS detection, and sandboxed tool adapters; add red‑team tests.
- Token/cost predictability: estimate per‑node budgets at plan time; enforce ceilings and parallelize only when dependencies allow.

## Initial KPIs
- DAG Fidelity vs. expert baseline
- Verification pass rate and time‑to‑verify
- Retrieval precision/recall for docs (planner vs. executor views)
- Calibrated confidence reliability (ECE/Brier)
- Compensated failure rate; MTTR on rollback
- Cost per successful, verified DAG

## Next Steps
1) Finalize core schemas: DAG IR, intent, validation results.
2) Define minimal FQL subset and verifier contract.
3) Implement structure‑aware doc ingestion and retrieval evaluation.
4) Prototype policy engine + executor with allow‑listed tool adapters.
5) Establish KPIs and a small benchmark suite for end‑to‑end runs.
